# Dataset Information

## Dataset Name

H2O High Resolution Tidal Hindcast

<!--
- **Brief description** (~200 words):
-->

## Description

The H2O High Resolution Tidal Hindcast dataset provides standardized
tidal energy data for five strategically selected U.S. coastal locations
with significant tidal energy potential. Developed collaboratively by
Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) and National Laboratory of
the Rockies (NLR), this dataset is funded by the U.S. Department of
Energy’s Hydropower and Hydrokinetic Office Marine Energy Resource
Assessment and Characterization project.

Generated using FVCOM 4.3.1 (Finite Volume Community Ocean Model) \[1\],
the dataset contains one year of high-resolution tidal energy data
including eastward and northward sea water velocities, surface
elevation, calculated speed, flow direction, and power density across 10
uniform sigma layers. The data follows
[CF-1.10](https://cfconventions.org/),
[ACDD-1.3](https://wiki.esipfed.org/ACDD), and [ME Data
Pipeline-1.0](https://github.com/tsdat/data_standards/blob/main/ME_DataStandards.pdf)
conventions and meets IEC 62600-201 \[2\] Stage 1 tidal resource
analysis standards.

The five locations include Aleutian Islands and Cook Inlet (Alaska),
Piscataqua River (New Hampshire), Puget Sound (Washington), and Western
Passage (Maine), with temporal resolutions ranging from half-hourly to
hourly and spanning complete annual cycles for each dataset. This
standardized dataset supports theoretical and technical resource
potential assessments, commercial development planning, policy analysis,
environmental planning, and research applications for the marine energy
community.

- **Dataset size**: ~10TB (combined all locations)

- **Growth rate**: Static dataset - no planned annual growth. Future
  expansions may add new coastal locations.

- **File formats**: NetCDF4 (\*.nc), Apache Parquet (.parquet), HDF5
  (.h5)

- **License**: US Government work (Freely Distributed)

# Example

H2O Tidal Hindcast dataset is available in multiple data products,
including point data for the duration of the model run. The python
library `marine_energy_hindcast` provides a simple interface to download
the data at a single point including the complete data for the 1 year
model run, metadata included in parquet files hosted by the AWS Open
Data Registry [US Tidal](https://registry.opendata.aws/us-tidal/). To
profivide additioval value, analysis and visualization functions are
included in the library include IEC 62600-201 \[2\] compliant joint
probability distribution, probability of exceedance calculations and
additional visualizations relevant to tidal energy resource assessment.

### Pre-requisites

- Python 3.10+
- Internet access to download data from AWS Open Data Registry

``` bash
pip install marine_energy_hindcast
```

### Download and Query Complete Data at Single Point

This example demonstrates how to download the complete tidal hindcast
data for a specific point. Users are expected to visit the Marine Energy
Atlas [Data
Library](https://maps.nlr.gov/marine-energy-atlas/data-viewer/data-library/layers)
to determine points of interest. The example below uses a point in Cook
Inlet, Alaska, near Nikiski. Which is a known tidal energy site with
significant potential for tidal energy development.

First the library is imported and the target coordinates are defined.
The `get_data_at_point` function is then used to download the data and
metadata for the specified point.

``` python
import marine_energy_hindcast.tidal as tidal_hindcast

# Target coordinates
# Cook Inlet, Near Nikiski, AK
lat = 60.750500
lon = -151.446533

df, metadata = tidal_hindcast.query_nearest_point(
    lat,
    lon,
    return_metadata=True
)
```

The `query_nearest_point` function returns a pandas DataFrame containing
the complete tidal hindcast data for the specified point, and a metadata
dictionary with information about the dataset. There are many different
ways to use this data. To start we will create visualizations specified
by the Tidal Energy Resource Assessment Standard IEC 62600-201 \[2\].

### Visualizing Tidal Data

The `marine_energy_hindcast.tidal.viz` module includes functions to
create common visualizations used in tidal energy resource assessment.
The following examples demonstrate how to create a joint probability
distribution plot, probability of exceedance plot, and time series plots
of speed, to direction, and surface elevation.

``` python
tidal_hindcast.viz.joint_probability_distribution(df, metadata, sigma_layer=1)
```

![Joint Probability Distribution
Example](./docs/img/py_output/ak_cook_inlet.wpto_high_res_tidal_hindcast.lat=60.750500.lon=-151.446533.tidal_joint_probability_distribution_sigma_layer_1_depth_range_5.44_to_6.75_m.png)

``` python
tidal_hindcast.viz.probability_of_exceedance(df, metadata)
```

![Velocity Exceedance
Example](./docs/img/py_output/ak_cook_inlet.wpto_high_res_tidal_hindcast.lat=60.750500.lon=-151.446533.velocity_exceedance_probability.png)

``` python
tidal_hindcast.viz.speed(df, metadata, start_date="2005-01-01", number_of_days=7)
```

![Speed Over Time
Example](./docs/img/py_output/ak_cook_inlet.wpto_high_res_tidal_hindcast.lat=60.732075.lon=-151.431580_7days_2005-01-01.sea_water_speed.png)

``` python
tidal_hindcast.viz.to_direction(df, metadata, start_date="2005-01-01", number_of_days=7)
```

![To Direction Over Time
Example](./docs/img/py_output/ak_cook_inlet.wpto_high_res_tidal_hindcast.lat=60.732075.lon=-151.431580_7days_2005-01-01.sea_water_to_direction.png)

``` python
tidal_hindcast.viz.surface_elevation(df, metadata, start_date="2005-01-01", number_of_days=7)
```

![Surface Elevation Over Time
Example](./docs/img/py_output/ak_cook_inlet.wpto_high_res_tidal_hindcast.lat=60.732075.lon=-151.431580_7days_2005-01-01.surface_elevation_analysis.png)

Additionally a full overview of the data can be created using the
`overview` function:

``` python
tidal_hindcast.viz.overview(df, metadata)
```

![Point Data Overview
Example](./docs/img/py_output/ak_cook_inlet.wpto_high_res_tidal_hindcast.lat=60.750500.lon=-151.446533.velocity_and_direction_overview.png)

Additional data resulting dataframe contains the complete tidal hindcast
data for the specified point as a pandas DataFrame, and the metadata is
returned as a dictionary. In the original data from FVCOM model the `u`
and `v` vectors are calculated at 10 uniform sigma layers from the
surface to the seafloor. This dataset includes additional calculated
variables that are prefixed with `vap_`, which stands for “value added
product”. The intent of the vap variables is to provide engineering data
columns that are ready for analysis and visualization.

| DataFrame Variable | Long Name | Units |
|----|----|----|
| `u` | Eastward Sea Water Velocity | m/s |
| `v` | North Sea Water Velocity | m/s |
| `vap_sea_water_speed_layer_<0-9>` | Sea Water Speed at the specified sigma layer | m/s |
| `vap_sea_water_power_density_layer_<0-9>` | Sea Water Power Density (`rho = 1025`) | W/m2 |
| `vap_water_column_sea_water_speed` | Depth Averaged Sea Water Speed | m/s |
| `vap_sea_water_to_direction` | Sea Water To Direction | deg clockwise from true north |
| `vap_surface_elevation` | Surface Elevation relative to Mean Sea Level (MSL) | m |
| `vap_sigma_layer_depth` | Layer Depth relative to MSL | m |
| `vap_depth` | Sea Floor Depth relative to MSL | m |
