# High Resolution Tidal Hindcast

## Description

What is this data in two sentences

Original model output is stored in NLR managed long term storage for a period of X years

Standardized data transforms raw model output data into a common format and includes:

* Time validation and conversion to a standard format
* Coordinate validation and conversion to a standard format
* Addition of calculated engineering values specific to tidal energy development including:
    * Flow Velocity
        * Averaged and at each depth layer
    * Flow Direction
        * Averaged and at each depth layer
    * Power Density
        * Averaged and at each depth layer
    * Depth
* Organization of files my month
* Common metadata descriptions (`attrs`) in all files detailing data generation specifications,
  conventions, and other relevant information
* Unified variable is all datasets including units, name, and descriptions

The development of this dataset was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy's
Hydropower and Hydrokinetic Office (H2O)
to improve our understanding of the U.S. tidal energy resource and to provide
critical information for tidal energy project development and tidal energy
converter design.

## Data Format

Standardized data is provided in netCDF4 format.

# Accessing Data


## Python Examples

Example scripts to extract tidal data are.

The easiest way to access and extract data from the Resource eXtraction tool
[`rex`](https://github.com/NatLabRockies/rex)

To use `rex` with [`HSDS`](https://github.com/NatLabRockies/hsds-examples) you will need
to install `h5pyd`:

```
pip install h5pyd
```

Next you'll need to configure HSDS:

```
hsconfigure
```

and enter at the prompt:

```
hs_endpoint = https://developer.nlr.gov/api/hsds
hs_username =
hs_password =
hs_api_key = 3K3JQbjZmWctY0xmIfSYvYgtIcM3CN0cb1Y2w9bf
```

**IMPORTANT: The example API key here is for demonstation and is rate-limited per IP. To get your own API key, visit https://developer.nlr.gov/signup/**

You can also add the above contents to a configuration file at `~/.hscfg`


```python
from rex import ResourceX

wave_file = '/nrel/US_wave/West_Coast/West_Coast_wave_2010.h5'
with ResourceX(wave_file, hsds=True) as f:
    meta = f.meta
    time_index = f.time_index
    swh = f['significant_wave_height']
```

`rex` also allows easy extraction of the nearest site to a desired (lat, lon)
location:

```python
from rex import ResourceX

wave_file = '/nrel/US_wave/West_Coast/West_Coast_wave_2010.h5'
lat_lon = (34.399408, -119.841181)
with ResourceX(wave_file, hsds=True) as f:
    lat_lon_swh = f.get_lat_lon_df('significant_wave_height', lat_lon)
```

or to extract all sites in a given region:

```python
from rex import ResourceX

wave_file = '/nrel/US_wave/West_Coast/West_Coast_wave_2010.h5'
jurisdication='California'
with ResourceX(wave_file, hsds=True) as f:
    ca_swh = f.get_region_df('significant_wave_height', jurisdiction,
                             region_col='jurisdiction')
```

If you would rather access the US Wave data directly using h5pyd:

```python
# Extract the average wave height
import h5pyd
import pandas as pd

# Open .h5 file
with h5pyd.File('/nrel/US_wave/West_Coast/West_Coast_wave_2010.h5', mode='r') as f:
    # Extract meta data and convert from records array to DataFrame
    meta = pd.DataFrame(f['meta'][...])
    # Significant Wave Height
    swh = f['significant_wave_height']
    # Extract scale factor
    scale_factor = swh.attrs['scale_factor']
    # Extract, average, and unscale wave height
    mean_swh = swh[...].mean(axis=0) / scale_factor

# Add mean wave height to meta data
meta['Average Wave Height'] = mean_swh
```

```python
# Extract time-series data for a single site
import h5pyd
import pandas as pd

# Open .h5 file
with h5pyd.File('/nrel/US_wave/West_Coast/West_Coast_wave_2010.h5', mode='r') as f:
    # Extract time_index and convert to datetime
    # NOTE: time_index is saved as byte-strings and must be decoded
    time_index = pd.to_datetime(f['time_index'][...].astype(str))
    # Initialize DataFrame to store time-series data
    time_series = pd.DataFrame(index=time_index)
    # Extract wave height, direction, and period
    for var in ['significant_wave_height', 'mean_wave_direction',
                'mean_absolute_period']:
    	# Get dataset
    	ds = f[var]
    	# Extract scale factor
    	scale_factor = ds.attrs['scale_factor']
    	# Extract site 100 and add to DataFrame
    	time_series[var] = ds[:, 100] / scale_factor
```
